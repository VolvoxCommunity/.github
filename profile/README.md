# 🌀 Volvox

**Where developers learn by doing, and doing leads to building something meaningful.**

Volvox is a software development company and programming learning community that believes the best way to level up your skills is to ship real code with real people. We're not about tutorials that gather digital dust—we're about collaborative projects that actually matter.

## What We're About

Founded in 2018 as a Discord community for aspiring developers, Volvox evolved into something bigger: a software company that still remembers its roots. We create production applications while teaching the next generation of developers how to contribute to real projects at any skill level.

Think of us as the place where "I'm learning to code" becomes "I'm building production software with a team."

## Our Approach

We don't gatekeep. We don't have arbitrary prerequisites. We have work items for everyone—from your first pull request to architecting complex systems. You learn by contributing to projects that real people will actually use, with guidance from developers who've been exactly where you are.

Our development philosophy is straightforward: write code that works, document it properly, test it thoroughly, and ensure it is maintainable. No shortcuts, no "we'll fix it later," no magic incantations you copy-paste without understanding.

## How to Get Involved

1. **Join our Discord** — This is where everything happens. Questions, collaboration, code reviews, and the occasional debate about tabs vs. spaces (spaces, obviously).
2. **Find a task that matches your skill level** — We maintain work items for contributors at every stage of their journey.
3. **Submit your first PR** — We'll review it, provide feedback, and help you ship it.
4. **Grow as a developer** — Take on more complex work as you're ready.

## Philosophy

We believe in:
- Learning through building
- Open source contribution as education
- Collaboration over competition
- Quality over speed (but we ship regularly)
- Supporting each other's growth

We're developers, learners, and builders. We take our work seriously but ourselves? Not so much.
